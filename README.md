## Regarding the team

### Workflow

At the beginning (if you use git in the terminal):
1. `git config --global user.name "NAME"` and `git config --global user.email "MAIL"` *(replace NAME by Arielle, Ferdinand, Louis or Theo and MAIL by the mail adress used on github.com)*
2. `git clone git@github.com:NoneOfAllOfTheAbove/OCR.git`
3. `git remote add origin git@github.com:NoneOfAllOfTheAbove/OCR.git`
4. `git checkout [the feature you are working on]` *(see the list of branches)*

After each significant modification:
1. `git add *`
2. `git commit -m "Well detailed message."`
3. `git push origin [the feature you are working on]` *(see the list of branches)*

### Rules

1. Respect the book of specifications (work on Linux, code guidelines...).
2. Push only on your corresponding branch (the branch with the name of the feature you are working on, refer to the list of branches).
3. Do commit regularly and describe what you have done in the commit message.
